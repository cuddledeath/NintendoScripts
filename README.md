# NintendoScripts
Repository for scripts that automate tasks on switch games using an arduino microcontroller.

Script I made to automate the 100 Super Jump challenge in Super Mario RPG. 

Uses asottile nintendo microcontrollers repository.

For the lufa repository, make sure to pull the older required files as the newest ones in the lufa repository don't seem to work with it. Beyond that just follow his directions. 

Also when I plugged in the arduino micro into my switch, the light did not blink.
